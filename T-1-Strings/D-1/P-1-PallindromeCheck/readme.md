## Pallindrome String

A string can be called a palindrome if we read it from forward or backward, it appears the same or in other words, we can say if we reverse a string and it is identical to the original string.

# Example

1. Str = ABBCBBA
   O/P = True

2. Str = ABCBA
   O/P = True

3. Str = TAMATAM
   O?P = False


# Ways to Solve (time/space)

1. Naive Method theta(n)/theta(n)
2. Efficient Method O(n)/O(1)
3. Recursion Method O(n)/O(n)
