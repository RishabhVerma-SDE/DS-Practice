# Subsequence String

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example

1. Str1 = ABBCBBA / Str2 = ABC
   O/P = True

2. Str = ABCBA / Str2 = ABBA
   O/P = True

3. Str = TAMATAM / Str2 = TMMT
   O?P = False
